{t:Draw me, dear Lord}
{c: Capo 3}

1. [D]Draw me, dear [G]Lord.[D]
Draw me to[G]day.[D]
From everything [G]else, dear Lord,[D]
Draw me a[A]way.

2. O Lord, this whole world
Seems to weigh me down.
All the cares, the strife the sin,
Within me and all around.

3. But, Lord, I want to set my heart,
And, Lord, I want to stay with You.
'Cause only when You're near to me
Is everything okay.

4. And though everything may fall apart
Or everything go my way,
It doesn't really matter, Lord,
As long as I gain You today.

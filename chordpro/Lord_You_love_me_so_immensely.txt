{t:Lord, You love me so immensely}

1. [C]Lord, You love me [G]so immensely;
[Am]I would love You [Em]more intensely.
[F]Every day and [C]every moment,
[F]O Lord, capture [G]me.
[C]Let my goal and [G]my life's theme be,
[Am]Lord, to love You [Em]more supremely;
[F]With all my [C]heart, Lord Jesus,
[F]Keep me faithful [G]unto [C]Thee.

2. Draw me, Lord, each day.
Take my veils away.
With a pure heart will I see You;
Lord I just love You.
Nothing else I seek;
No one else for me.
I would fully and absolutely
Give my whole being unto Thee.

{t:How we love the glorious name}

1. [G]How we love the glorious name,
The name of [C]Je[G]sus!
'Tis the name above all names—
On earth or in [D]heav'n.[A7][D7]
As we [G]breathe this precious [G7]name,
Darkness and [C]death cannot remain;
For we [G]call and get the [D]Person of that [G]name![C][G]

2. Dear Lord Jesus, with our tongues—
We gladly confess Thy name,
To the glory of the Father God above.
For to us to speak Thy praise,
Is the enjoyment of our days;
Calling JESUS is to call the One we love!

(this song may be sung with "Touching Jesus is all that really matters")

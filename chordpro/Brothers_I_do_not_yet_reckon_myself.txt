{t:Brothers, I do not yet reckon myself}
{c: Capo 3}

[D]Brothers, I [Bm]do not yet [G]reckon my[A7]self to have [D]laid [Bm]hold;
[G]But one [A7]thing—
For[D]getting the [Bm]things which [G]are be[A7]hind
And [D]stretching [Bm]forward to [G]what is be[A7]fore,
[D]I pur[Bm]sue to[G]ward the [A7]goal
[D]For the [Bm]prize of the [G]high call[A7]ing
The high [D]calling of [Bm]God [G]in Christ [A7]Je[D]sus.[Bm][G][A7]

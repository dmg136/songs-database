{t:Morning dawn had arisen}

1. [G]Morning dawn had a[Bm]risen,
[C]Abraham saddled [D]his donkey,
[G]Took his two young men [Bm]with him
And [C]Isaac, his be[D]loved son.
[C]Lord, You're God's only [G]Son[C]
And of God begot[G]ten[C]
"This is My be[G]loved Son, in [D]whom[C]
I am well-[G]pleased."

2. To his young men he said then,
"Stay and we'll return to you."
To Moriah he led him,
His son Isaac, just them two.
Just the son and the father,
Speaking with one another.
Isaac said, "My father!" Abraham
said, "Here I am."

3. As You spoke with Your Father
You bore the wood God laid on You;
As a lamb to the slaughter
Obedient to the death were You.
Precious blood of a Lamb,
Slain from when earth began,
Laid Your life down for Your sheep, in love,
that I might live.

4. Man of sorrows, I love You.
From You men did hide their face.
With no majesty to You,
Despised, forsaken, and disgraced.
For my sins You were crushed.
Lord, I love You so much.
Chastened, scourged and then pierced through, my griefs
and sorrows bore.

5. Dead in sins and offenses,
I'm a bruised reed—smoking flax.
Yet to death You were given,
For of Your sheep, You'd not lose one.
Like the woman, I'd weep,
Flow my tears at Your feet.
Jesus Lord, I just love You—dear Lord,
Jesus my Lord.

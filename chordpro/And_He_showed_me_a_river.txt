{t:And He showed me a river}
{c: Capo 2}
{c: Revelation 22:1, Psalms 36:8}

1. And He [D]showed me a [Bm]river
Of [Em]water of [A]life,
[D]Bright as [Bm]crystal,
Pro[Em]ceeding [A]out
Of the [D]throne of [Bm]God
[Em]And [A]of the [Bm]Lamb.
And [D]Thou shalt make them to [Bm]drink
Of the [Em]river of [A]Thy plea[D]sures.

2. There is a river,
The streams whereof make glad
The city of God.
She shall not be moved.
God shall help her.
God's in her midst.
They shall be abundantly satisfied
With the fatness of Thy house.

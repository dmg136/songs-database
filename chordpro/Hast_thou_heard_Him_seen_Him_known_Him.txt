1. [G]Hast thou [Bm]heard Him, seen Him, [C]known Him?[D][G]
Is not [Bm]thine a captured [C]heart?[D][G]
Chief [Bm]among ten thousand [C]own Him;
Joyful [D]choose the better part.

[C]Capti[D]vated by His [G]beauty,[Bm][C]
Worthy [D]tribute haste to [G]bring;[C]

2. Idols once they won thee, charmed thee,
Lovely things of time and sense;
Gilded thus does sin disarm thee,
Honeyed lest thou turn thee thence.

3. What has stripped the seeming beauty
From the idols of the earth?
Not a sense of right or duty,
But the sight of peerless worth.

4. Not the crushing of those idols,
With its bitter void and smart;
But the beaming of His beauty,
The unveiling of His heart.

5. Who extinguishes their taper
Till they hail the rising sun?
Who discards the garb of winter
Till the summer has begun?

6. 'Tis that look that melted Peter,
'Tis that face that Stephen saw,
'Tis that heart that wept with Mary,
Can alone from idols draw:

7. Draw and win and fill completely,
Till the cup o'erflow the brim;
What have we to do with idols
Who have companied with Him?

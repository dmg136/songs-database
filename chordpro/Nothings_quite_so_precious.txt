{t:Nothing's quite so precious}

1. [C]Nothing's quite so [F]precious
[C]As Jesus [G7]in my spirit.
[Am]He takes a[F]way the care
And [D7]fills me with His [G7]peace.
[C]He never [F]leaves me,
[C]E'en as the [G7]days grow weary.
[Am]His presence [F]goes with me.
My [D7]soul delights to [G7]hide in His [C]arms.

{soc}
[Am]I call His name, "Lord Jesus,
Help me in my [G]weakness."
[Am]So faithfully [F]each day in me
He proves His [D7]life is so suf[G]ficient.[G7]
{eoc}

2. Nothing's quite so precious
As Jesus in my spirit.
He turns my heart to Him,
To feast upon His life.
It's nothing I do—
His mercy's just upon me.
And God's free gift of grace
Becomes an endless joy to me.

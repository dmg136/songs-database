{t:Immersed in Thy love}

1. [C]Immersed in Thy love;
Fresher than [Em]morning dew;
Here I'm [F]kept away from [Dm]every earthly [G]care.[G7]
Such tender [C]feeling;
Caressed by [Em]my Beloved;
You're the [F]loveliest, much [Dm]fairer than the [G]fair.[E7]

{soc}
Moments with [Am]You,
How affection[Em]ate!
Now I [F]seize this oppor[Dm]tunity to [G]say[G7]
That I [C]love You.
I will [Em]be with You
All my [Dm7]days,[G7] come what [C]may.
{eoc}

2. I cannot help it;
I'm so in love with You
For I've tasted Your divine heavenly wine.
I'm soaked with Thy love,
I pour my all on You.
What my future holds for me, my Lord are Thine.

3. I'm so attracted
By Your constraining love,
And Your Name is sweet as ointment poured forth
I'm captivated by Your dear Person, Lord.
Draw me from this age to pursue only You...

{t:Lord, I do thank You for another day}

1. [D]Lord, I do [Bm]thank You for an[Em]other [A]day
[D]To practice [Bm]living You, in [Em]You to [A]stay,
Lord, [G]grant me the [Em]grace, Your life [Bm]mine to re[G]place
[D]Two lives one, oh [Em]what a [A7]sweet em[D]brace.

2. Lord, You are glory, You are beauty;
Divine and human woven utterly
Have mercy on me, that I may be
Joined to You, expressing You daily.

3. Lord, be my pattern, humble and lowly;
Save me from self and pride and vainglory.
Preserve and keep me, for Your economy,
Live in me, possess me wholly.

4. Lord, I do love You, operate in me,
Be my salvation, save me constantly
To hold forth Your word, life to others afford;
Shining You, so radiantly, dear Lord.

5. Lord, I'm so saturated with Your joy
That I am drunken, You as wine enjoy;
I'd pour out my being, as a drink offering
Upon You, God satisfying.

6. Lord, my desire is to be found in You
As lived out righteousness, give me this view.
Lord, clothe and stitch me, with embroidery
Day by day, inwrought Your gold in me.

{t:There's a gospel of today}
{c:Capo 5}

1. [G]There's a gospel [C]of today
That [Dadd9]says believe and [C]you'll be saved and [G]then
You can go to [C]heaven and see the [Dadd9]pearly gates
And [C]walk the golden [G]streets;

{soc}
Words like [Em]these[C] fail to [D]treat
All the [G]vani[Em]ty[C] that is [D]hidden in [G]me.
{eoc}

2. But the gospel is to me
The Triune God within humanity
As the Spirit reaching me to be in me
The one reality;

{soc}
Love untold—Gospel Thee
Never getting old—story told eternally.
{eoc}

3. Left the ninety-nine behind—
You searched until the lost sheep You did find,
Laid me on Your shoulders there, You bore me in
Your tender loving care;

{soc}
Rejoicing—You found me
Though a small lost sheep—You gave all to come find me.
{eoc}

4. Sweeping in my deepest parts,
You lit a lamp and searched my inward heart,
Sanctifying deep within You shined in me,
Exposed me of my sin;

{soc}
Repenting—now I see
Lord, You're sprinkling me—with the blood You shed for me.
{eoc}

5. Eagerly awaiting me
That I the slightest turn to Thee would make
Though my life had been a wreck, You ran to me
And fell upon my neck

{soc}
Kissing me, affectionately;
Killed the calf for me—"Let us eat and be merry."
{eoc}

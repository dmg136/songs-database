{t:When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion}

1. [D]When the Lord turned a[G]gain the cap[D]tivity of [G]Zi[D]on,
We were [G]like them that [D]dream,
We were [G]like them that [D]dream.

2. Then was [D]our mouth filled with [G]laughter,
And our [D]tongue with [G]sing[D]ing:
Then said [G]they among the [D]nations,
The [G]Lord hath done great [D]things,
The [G]Lord hath done great [D]things for them.

{soc}
The [G]Lord[Em] hath done great [D]things for us;
Where[G]of[Em] we are [A]glad.
The [G]Lord[Em] hath done great [D]things for us;
Where[G]of[Em] we are [A]glad.
{eoc}

3. Turn [D]again our cap[G]tivity, O [D]Lord, as the [G]stre[D]ams,
As the [G]streams in the [D]south,
As the [G]streams in the [D]south.

4. They that sow in [G]tears shall [D]reap in [G]joy,[D]
They that [G]sow in [D]tears shall [G]reap in [D]joy.

5. He that goeth forth and [G]weepeth,
Bearing [D]precious seed, shall [G]doubt[D]less,
Come a[G]gain with re[D]joicing,
Come a[G]gain with re[D]joicing,
Bringing [G]his sheaves with [D]him.

{soc}
The [G]Lord[Em] hath done great [D]things for us;
Where[G]of[Em] we are [A]glad.
The [G]Lord[Em] hath done great [D]things for us;
Where[G]of[Em] we are [A]glad.
{eoc}

6. [D]When the Lord turned a[G]gain the cap[D]tivity of [G]Zi[D]on,
We were [G]like them that [D]dream,
We were [G]like them that [D]dream.

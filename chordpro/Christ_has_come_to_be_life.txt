{t:Christ has come to be life}

1. [G]Christ [C]has [G]come to be [C]life, the [G]processed di[C]vine Trini[G]ty.[C]
[G]God [C]the [G]Father's the [C]source, a [G]fountain e[C]merging to [G]be.
God the [D]Son as a [C]gushing up [G]spring,
And the [D]Spirit's a river for [C]life impart[G]ing
Oh [Em]how can this miracle [C]be? The [Am]Triune God [C]flowing in [D]me![D7]
Oh, [G]I've [C]got [G]rivers of [C]life flowing [G]out of my [C]innermost [G]being![C]
[G]I've [C]got [G]rivers of [C]life flowing [G]out of my [C]innermost [G]being!

{soc}
As this [C]life [D]flows through [G]me, [Em]I'm sup[C]plied a[D]bundant[G]ly.
[Em]His [C]life [G]nullifies [D]sin! [Em]Power [C]springs [G]now from with[D]in!
To be [Em]free,[C] over[G]coming spon[D7]taneous[G]ly.[C][G]

2. Yet this life though it frees, is not meant for mere victory.
God is full of intent and never could flow aimlessly.
So this life has a totality, a consummate issue encompassing me.
Life moves and life grows, life shapes as it flows
Now I share in this life's destiny.
Oh, I've got rivers of life flowing out of my innermost being!
I've got rivers of life flowing out of my innermost being!

{soc}
We'll abide mutually, God and man revealed to be
Lamb, Wife, Spirit, and Bride.
Come! Drink! And riverside, 
Grows the tree, our enjoyment for eternity!
{eoc}

3. So I've no cause to frown as one who's received this zoe.
I know life runs its course and triumphs inevitably.
I'm required just to stay in the flow, 
If I do the drinking then God gives the growth.
So there's joy in my heart, and a spring in my step, 
And a smile on my face as I sing,
Oh, I've got rivers of life flowing out of my innermost being!
I've got rivers of life flowing out of my innermost being!

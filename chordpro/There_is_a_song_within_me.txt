{t:There is a song within me}

1. [C]There is a [CM7]song with[Dm]in me;[G7]
It's a [Dm]song of Jesus [G7]moving
In the [C]gardens of my [CM7]heart.[C]
This Jesus [CM7]lives with[Dm]in me,[G7]
Planting [Dm]flowers of Him[G7]self
There to be [C]watered by my [CM7]Love.

{soc}
[C]I'm loving [Dm]Jesus,[G7] this lovely [C]Person[CM7]
With perso[Dm]nality so [G7]strong.
He brought me [C]to Himself[CM7]
And said to [Dm]me,[G7] "All of your [C]heart's desire[CM7]
is found in [Dm]Me;
I'm all you [G7]need and I love [C]you."
{eoc}

2. There is a peace within me
That has sprung from deep contentment
With my Lord, who's All in All.
For my delight is in this
Living One inside of me
Who is Himself, my everything.

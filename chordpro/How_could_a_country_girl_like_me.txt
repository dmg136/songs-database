5. As King of kings You became a man,
You died for me—I've been redeemed,
In resurrection made us queen
To marry You, my King.

I now possess Your divinity;
In life and nature we're the same:
Both human and divine.

And Your Person captured me,
For I've been kissed by Thee.

Lord, all my heart possessing
In all my being—transforming
To be Your bride and queen.

I'm Yours alone.

In Your name I'm charmed,

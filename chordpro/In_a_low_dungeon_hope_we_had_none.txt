{t:In a low dungeon, hope we had none}

1. [G]In a low dungeon, [C]hope we had none;
[D]Tried to believe, but [G]faith didn't come;
God, our sky clearing, [C]Jesus appearing,
[D] We by God were trans[G]fused!
[D] We by God were trans[G]fused!

{soc}
[C]Propitiation [G]made by the blood,
[D]Jesus' redemption [G]bought us for God!
[C]No condemnation, [G]justification!
[D]We have peace toward [G]God!
[D]We have peace toward [G]God!

2. Born into Adam, dying we were;
We had a sickness no one could cure.
God, His Son sending, old Adam ending;
He is dead, we are free!
He is dead, we are free!

3. Now we're rejoicing, standing in grace,
Oh hallelujah! Sin is erased!
God, in us flowing, in our hearts growing,
We are saved in His life!
We are saved in His life!

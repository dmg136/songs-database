{t:Lord, now I see}

1. [D]Lord, now I [DM7]see,
You only [G]want me to be[Em]lieve
Not to [A]change.
In all my [D]failures [A]and de[Bm]feats
To be[G]lieve what [D]You have done,
And [G]not in [Em]what I [A]see.

2. Lord I believe,
When all around me is defeat
And it seems that nothing's changing outwardly.
No! I'm not discouraged,
I'm believing You.

3. Yes, I believe,
And there is no demand on me.
Simple faith, yes, that is all You want from me.
Freed from anxious doubting—
I'm free to just believe!

4. Believing You,
Because, Lord, You are my success!
When I fail, all I must do is just confess,
And go on enjoying You—
I [G]love be[Em]lie[A]ving [D]You!

{t:Prod me with Your loving hands}

1. [A]Prod me with Your loving [F#m]hands,
[D]Stir me from my deep im[E]passe.
I [A]long to flee this stagnant [F#m]rut;
My [D]soul, my prison, deadened [E]lot,
Which [A]end is just to taste Your [F#m]wrath;
So [D]set me on the narrow [E]path.
Thorns and [C#m]thistles may line this [F#m]road
But it [D]leads me to the [E]mutual a[A]bode.[A7]

2. [D]Lift me up with Your [E]mighty hand
A[C#m]bove this frenzied earthly [F#m]land.
Set [D]me on the [E]mount to see
What the [A]world can offer [A7]me;
Till I [D]see the vani[E]ty from on [C#m]high
And earthly de[F#m]sires I bid good[D]bye
And [E7]set my eyes on [A]You.[D][A]

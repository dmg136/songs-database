{t:O Love, that wilt not let me go}

1. [D]O Love, that [A]wilt not let me [Bm]go,
[G]I rest my [D]weary soul in [A]Thee;
[D]I give Thee [A]back the life I [Bm]owe,
[G]That in Thine [Em]ocean depths its [G]flow
May richer, [A]fuller [D]be.

2. O Light, that followest all my way,
I yield my flickering torch to Thee;
My heart restores its borrowed ray,
That in Thy sunshine's blaze its day
May brighter, fairer be.

3. O Joy, that seekest me through pain,
I cannot close my heart to Thee;
I trace the rainbow through the rain,
And feel the promise is not vain
That morn shall tearless be.

4. O Cross, that liftest up my head,
I dare not ask to fly from Thee;
I lay in dust life's glory dead,
And from the ground there blossoms red
Life that shall endless be.

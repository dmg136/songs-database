{t:When I've run the race before me}

1. [G]When I've run the race be[D]fore me
And have [G]fought to [C]victo[G]ry,
[D]I'll be [G]raptured to the [Em]glory of the [D]Lord;
When I've [G]kept the faith at [Em]any cost,
The [C]Holy City [G]then
I'll re[C]ceive as [D]my re[G]ward.[G7]

{soc}
I'll be [C]raptured into glory,
In the [G]Holy [C]City [G]dwell—
New Je[D]rusalem, New Je[G]rusalem;[G7]
With the [C]overcomers shouting,
How our [G]praises [C]then will [G]swell,
In the [D]New Jerusa[G]lem.

2. As a pilgrim here I wander;
While afflicted, I rejoice,
For a better land I soon expect to see;
Though all others seek for earthly gain,
The Holy City e'er
Will my aspiration be.

3. Though my feet are often wearied
On the rough and rugged path,
Just by thinking of that city, I'm restored;
Though my eyes be filled with tears,
My heart will evermore be fixed
On that City, my reward.

4. With strong purpose I now wrestle,
And I run toward the goal;
I pursue the prize, God's highest to obtain;
Pressing forward toward the mark,
I run forgetting all behind,
Thus the Holy City gain.

{soc}
By His love and through His grace I'll
In the Holy City live—
New Jerusalem, New Jerusalem;
All saints leaping, singing, shouting,
To the Lord their praises give,
In the New Jerusalem.

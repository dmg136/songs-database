{t:Just one touch of You, dear Lord}

1. [D]Just one touch of You, dear Lord,
Just one look into Your [A]eyes,
[G]Just one kiss from You,
You're [D]all I need, my [A]Love.

2. [D]Let me hear again Your voice.
You are now my final [A]choice.
[G]Speak in love to me.
I'll [D]waste myself on [A]Thee.

{soc}
[G]Nothing and no one can [D]satisfy me
but [A]You any[D]more.
[G]Jesus, I love You, my [D]only desire.
Oh [A]Lord, I [G]just love [D]You.
{eoc}

3. Let me touch You as before,
Craving for You more and more,
You're the very best!
I'll drop the rest for You.

4. Oh, the kisses of Your mouth
Make my lips to praise and shout.
Lord, You're full of grace
Oh, what a taste my Love!

{soc}
Nothing and no one can satisfy me
but You anymore.
Jesus, my first Love, oh set me on fire
For You, my only desire.
{eoc}

5. Just infuse me with Your eyes.
Oh! This union satisfies!
As I gaze on You.
I'm filled with You, my Love.

6. Only You alone will do.
I can't make it without You.
Keep me close to You,
Just joined to You as one.

{soc}
Nothing and no one can satisfy me
but You anymore.
Jesus, I love You, my only desire.
Oh, set my heart on fire.
{eoc}

7. I repent and now return,
Grant my heart for You to burn.
Flame in me this zeal.
Lord, be in me so real!

8. (Repeat previous verse)

{soc}
Jesus, my first Love! Oh Jesus, my best Love,
I now return to You.
Jesus, my first Love! Oh Jesus, my best Love,
I love You. I just love You!
{eoc}

{t:Fallen, in her condition}

1. [D]Fallen, in her con[Bm]dition
[G]Israel left her [A7]Love.
She was [D]stubborn in her pos[Bm]ition—
To [G]God she would not [A]come.

2. [G]Under the Lord's chas[D]tising
She [Em]was an unturned [A7]cake.
But Je[D]hovah, with love un[Bm]changing
Makes [G]Israel [Em]His own [A]son—a [A7]change to [D]make.

3. You became a [Bm]man—
[G]Cord of love to [A7]me.
I am [D]drawn with loving [Bm]bands
[G]And embraced by [A]Thee.

4. [G]From the heavens [D]came,
You stepped [Em]out of eterni[A7]ty,
Died and [D]rose as a [Bm]man
That [G]You [Em]could im[A]part Your [A7]life to [D]me.

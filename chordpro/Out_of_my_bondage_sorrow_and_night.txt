{t:Out of my bondage, sorrow, and night}
{c:Capo 3}

1. [D]Out of my [A]bondage, sorrow, and [Bm]night,
Jesus, I [G]come! Je[A7]sus, I [D]come!
Into Thy [A]freedom, gladness, and [Bm]light,
Jesus, I [Em]come [A7]to [D]Thee!
Out of my [G]sickness into Thy [A]health,
Out of my [F#m]want and into Thy [Bm]wealth,
Out of my [G]sin and into Thy[A]self,
Jesus, I [Em]come [A]to [D]Thee!

2. Out of my shameful failure and loss,
Jesus, I come! Jesus, I come!
Into the glorious gain of Thy cross,
Jesus, I come to Thee!
Out of earth's sorrows into Thy balm,
Out of life's storm and into Thy calm,
Out of distress to jubilant psalm,
Jesus, I come to Thee!

3. Out of unrest and arrogant pride,
Jesus, I come! Jesus, I come!
Into Thy blessed will to abide,
Jesus, I come to Thee!
Out of myself to dwell in Thy love,
Out of despair into raptures above,
Upward for aye on wings like a dove,
Jesus, I come to Thee!

4. Out of the fear and dread of the tomb,
Jesus, I come! Jesus, I come!
Into the joy and pleasure, Thine own,
Jesus, I come to Thee!
Out of the depths of ruin untold,
Into the flock Thy love doth enfold,
Ever Thy glorious face to behold,
Jesus, I come to Thee!

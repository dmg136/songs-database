{t:Lord Jesus, You're lovely}

1. [C]Lord Jesus, You're [G]lovely.
You're [F]more to be de[C]sired,
Than [Am]any earthly [Em]pleasure.
You're [Dm]fine, beyond com[G]pare.
Lord [C]Jesus, Your [G]beauty
Does [F]far exceed all [C]others.
You're [Am]comely and You're [Em]tender.
You're [Dm7]radiant [G7]and You're [C]fair.

2. When I behold You Jesus,
You draw my heart completely.
I cannot turn away Lord,
I rest in Your embrace;
And time is gone there's only
Your holy, matchless presence
Abiding in You, gazing
Upon Your glorious face.

3. I give my life to You Lord,
For You alone are worthy.
There's nothing and there's no one
That I desire but You.
May all my days be Yours, Lord,
My heart be given to love You,
To treasure and to serve You
By Your sufficient grace.

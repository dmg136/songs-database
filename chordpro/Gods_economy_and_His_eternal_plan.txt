{t:God's economy and His eternal plan}
{c:Capo 3}

1. [C]God's econo[CM7]my
and [F]His eternal [G]plan,
His [C]heart's desire and in[CM7]tention
is [F]to be one with [G]man.
Yet [F]man has failed com[C]pletely
through[Em]out all histo[Am]ry.
But, [F]Hallelujah! [C]Praise the Lord!
God's [F]life is now in [G]me.

2. Now this [C]life in me is [CM7]flowing
as the [F]river of water of [G]life,
Washing a[C]way all my [CM7]sins,
my [F]cares, and all my [G]strife.
This [F]life is over[C]coming
situ[Em]ations in my [Am]day.
[F]Hallelujah! [C]Praise the Lord!
for [F]this is [G]what I [C]pray:[CM7]

{soc}
[C]Lord [CM7]Jesus, [F]I love [G]You!
I give You-[C]the pre[CM7]eminence in [F]what I [G]do.
En[C]joying [CM7]You is the [F]overcoming [G]way.
Thank You [C]for Your re[CM7]covery.
Your [F]Word we [G]will o[C]bey.
{eoc}

3. Thank You for our situations
and the environments we are in.
That we'd turn to You in all things,
and turn away from sin.
We'd drop all our anxieties
and put our trust in You.
And experience this living Christ
because He's ever new.


4. Now the church life is so precious
with all the saints so dear.
Enjoying all Your riches
our vision is so clear.
That all would prophesy
of Christ from what they've seen.
According to Your Scripture
in First Corinthians fourteen.

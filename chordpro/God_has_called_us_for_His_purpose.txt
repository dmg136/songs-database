{t: God has called us for His purpose}

1. [D]God has called us for His pur[Bm]pose,
[Em]His economy so glo[A]rious,
[G]For which He was fully [F#m]pro[Bm]cessed;
[Em]Consummated now is He![A7]
[D]As the Spirit, He in[Bm]dwells us;
[Em]As our God alloted por[A]tion,
[G]Working out His full sal[F#m]va[Bm]tion,
[Em]Making us the [A7]same as He [D]is.

{soc}
[D7]Oh, may a [G]clear, controlling vision of[A]
The Lord's e[F#m]conomy direct my [Bm]heart,
And burn in [Em]me until my spirit's [A]wholly [A7]set a[D]fire![D7]
With spirit [G]strong and active we'll press on[A]
To consum[F#m]mate God's [Bm]goalâ€”[D]
[G]New Jerusa[A]lem, Hallelu[D]jah![G][D]

2. Jesus lived the God-man pattern,
Set the way for us to follow,
He denied His natural man and
Was obedient unto death,
Once He was the only God-man;
Now we are His duplication.
As the many grains we're blended
As His corporate reproduction.

Living out His resurrection,
Dying to the flesh and soul-life.
Living by the mingled spirit,
Natural man we will deny.
Now we're living in the Body,
Every day we're overcoming,
Striving for the peak of Zion,
Watching for our Lord's appearing.

God and man will have one living,
Always in the mingled spirit;
We two are incorporated
One organic entity!
This the vision of the ages
Will control our daily living
That the Lord may have His Body
Shining as the holy city.

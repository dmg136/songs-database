{t:Down from His glory}
 
1. [D]Down from His glory,
Ever living [G]story,
My God and [A]Savior came,
And Jesus [D]was His name.
Born in a manger,
To His own a [G]stranger,
A Man of [D]sorrows, tears and [A]ago[D]ny.
 
{soc}
O how I love Him! How I a[Em]dore Him![A]
My breath, my sunshine, my all in [D]all!
The great Cre[Gm]ator became my [D]Savior,
And all God's [A]fullness [A7] dwelleth in [D]Him.
{eoc}
 
2. What condescension,
Bringing us redemption;
That in the dead of night,
Not one faint hope in sight,
God, gracious, tender,
Laid aside His splendor,
Stooping to woo, to win, to save my soul.
 
3. Without reluctance,
Flesh and blood His substance
He took the form of man,
Revealed the hidden plan.
O glorious myst'ry,
Sacrifice of Calv'ry,
And now I know Thou art the great "I AM."

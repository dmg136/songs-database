{t:If I gained the world, but lost the Savior}

1. [Bm]If I gained the [A]world, but lost the [G]Savior,[A]
[Bm]Were my life worth [A]living for a [G]day?[A]
[G]Could my yearning [A]heart find rest and [D]com[Bm]fort
[C]In the things that soon must pass [A]away?
If I [Bm]gained the world, but lost the [G]Savior,
Would my [Bm]gain be worth the lifelong [G]strife?[A]
[G]Are all earthly [A]pleasures worth com[D]par[Bm]ing
[G]For a moment [A]with a Christ-filled [D]life?

2. Had I wealth and love in fullest measure,
And a name revered both far and near,
Yet no hope beyond, no harbor waiting,
Where my storm-tossed vessel I could steer;
If I gained the world, but lost the Savior,
Who endured the cross and died for me,
Could then all the world afford a refuge,
Whither, in my anguish, I might flee?

3. O what emptiness!—without the Savior
'Mid the sins and sorrows here below!
And eternity, how dark without Him!
Only night and tears and endless woe!
What, though I might live without the Savior,
When I come to die, how would it be?
O to face the valley's gloom without Him!
And without Him all eternity!

4. O the joy of having all in Jesus!
What a balm the broken heart to heal!
Ne'er a sin so great, but He'll forgive it,
Nor a sorrow that He does not feel!
If I have but Jesus, only Jesus,
Nothing else in all the world beside—
O then everything is mine in Jesus;
For my needs and more He will provide.

{t:Lord Jesus, I love You, You're my all}

1. [D]Lord Jesus, I love [DM7]You.
You're my [G]all—[Gm]
You're my [D]all in [A]all.
[D]You gave me life indeed;
You're all I [G]need,[Gm]
You're all I [D]need.[A]
[Em]Real peace and [G]joy I never [A]knew,
[Em]Until in [G]spirit I touched [A]You, so—

{soc}
[G]Lord, I just [D]open [Em]up to [A]You;
[G]I let You [D]do what You [Em]want to [A]do.
[G]Lord, I just [D]give my[Em]self to [A]You,
'Cause I [G]love You—Lord, I [D]do.
{eoc}

2. [D]You save me all day [DM7]long;
Though I'm [G]weak,[Gm]
You're so [D]strong.[A]
[D]The flow of life and peace
[Bm]Within me shows the way,
Hour by [G]hour,[Gm] day by [D]day;[A]
[Em]And if through [G]weakness I should [A]fall,
[Em]You always [G]save me when I [A]call, so—
(Repeat Chorus)

3. [D]O Lord, [Bm]one touch with Thee
Brought [D]life into me.
And [Bm]now I can't live without You.
You're my [G]only delight—
You've made [Em]everything right
With a [C]love that constrains me
Till I [A]say that—
(Repeat Chorus)

[D]You're my [G]lover—[Gm] You're my [D]all.

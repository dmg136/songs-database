{t:He washed away my sins}

1. [D]He washed away my sins,
Gave me a brand new [Bm]heart;
A heart to [G]love Him, trust Him,
[E7]Seek Him in His [A]Word.[A7]

{soc}
He tells me guard thy [D]heart
Above all that thou [Bm]guardest;
For out of [G]it, flows the [E7]springs,
The springs of [A]life.[A7]
(after final verse)The springs of [D]life.
{eoc}

2. He walks with me each day;
I open up to Him;
He is my life, my stay,
And everything I need.

3. And sometimes when I fail,
I forget that He's there;
He's just waiting, watching,
Then He draws me near.

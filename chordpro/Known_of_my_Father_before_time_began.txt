2. Father, You knew me a long time ago.
In Your foreknowledge, Your mercy to show,
You foreordained me Your glory to know,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah!

3. Son, in Your blood, the most precious of all,
I have been purchased and saved from the fall.
Your resurrection's my reason to call,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah!

4. Spirit, You came and You sanctified me.
You gave me faith when my eyes couldn't see.
Now You're the Spirit of life within me,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah!

5. You are my Father and I have Your seed!
I have been purchased and I am redeemed!
I have the Spirit within me indeed!
Hallelujah, Hallelujah!

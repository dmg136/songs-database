{t:More of our heart, dear Lord, we'd give You now}

1. [G]More of our [Em]heart, dear Lord, we'd [Am]give You [D]now;
[G]Even more [Em]ground to You, Lord, [Am]we'd al[B7]low.
[Em]All that distracts us we'd despise,
All that draws away our [Am]eyes—
Lord, do fill our vision
[D]'Til the morning [D7]star has risen!

{soc}
[G]We would count [Em]all things loss, but [Am]Jesus [D]gain;
[G]Our inward [Em]parts cry out for [Am]You to [B7]reign.
[Em]Worthy You are our heart to claim—
Come, engrave on us Your [Am]name,
We would [D]love You, [D7]Jesus, [G]more.
{eoc}

2. Less we would argue, Lord, and go our way;
More we would say "Amen" to what You say.
Grant us a walk to You conformed,
'Til our living is transformed.
We adore You, Jesus—
May a pure love for You seize us.

{soc}
Any unwillingness, Lord, quickly slay;
Even by faith we open all the way—
Rising to heights of love unknown,
Christ our destiny alone,
We would love You, Jesus, more!
{eoc}

{t:I am crucified with Christ}

{soc}
[D]I am crucified with [G]Christ
And it [D]is no longer I[G] who [D]liveth,
But it is [G]Christ who lives in [A]me;[A7]
And the [D]life which I now [G]live
In the [D]flesh, I [G]live in faith—
The [D]faith in the Son of [A]God
Who [G]loved and gave Him[A]self up for [D]me.
{eoc}

1. And now I'm walking by the [G]Spirit
Step by [D]step, day by [G]day,
O Lord, I [D]love You.
You're the [G]precious One to [A]me.[A7]
As I [D]do this and [G]that
Lord, re[D]mind me where You're [G]at;
You're in my [D]spirit,
Dis[G]pensing [A]grace to [D]me.

2. And now I'm walking by the Spirit,
Marching on toward the goal.
O Lord, Your purpose
Means everything to me.
All self-love I lay aside
For the churches, for Your Bride,
For the fulfillment
Of Your economy.

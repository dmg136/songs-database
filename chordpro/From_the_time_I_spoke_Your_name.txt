{t:From the time I spoke Your name}
{c:Capo 3}

1. [D]From the time I spoke Your name,
Lord, my [G]life's not been the [D]same
Since I called on the [Bm]only One who'd [Em]save me.[A]
When for[D]saken, in despair—
Who'd have [G]thought that You'd be [D]there!
Now I've found out, [A7]Jesus, You're a[D]live!

{soc}
Now my [G]eyes begin to see
I'm living [D]as I ought to be,
As this [G]turning, burning [Em]God
moves in my [A]heart...
I don't [D]care now how I feel;
I just [G]know that this is [D]real,
And I know, oh [A7]Jesus, You're a[D]live!
{eoc}

2. All my friends might think it's square—
Since I touched You, I don't care—
For I've found You're the only life worth living.
Though some mock and criticize,
Lord, they just don't realize
That I've found out, Jesus, You're alive!

3. It's no statue that I call,
Not a picture on the wall,
But a person who lives His life within me.
Wish they'd told me long before,
All You want's an open door
And that really, Jesus, You're alive!

{t:Whenever the heart shall turn to the Lord}

1. [D]Whenever the [F#]heart shall [Bm]turn to the [F#]Lord,
The [D]veil shall be [G]taken a[A]way.[A7]
So [D]turn your [F#]heart to the [Bm]Lord all the [F#]day,
And the [D]veil shall be [G]taken [A]a[D]way.[D7]

{soc}
Now the [G]Lord is the Spirit,
And where the [F#m]Spirit of the [Bm]Lord is,
There is [E]liberty—[E7]such liber[A]ty!
When[D]ever the [F#]heart shall [Bm]turn to the [F#]Lord,
The [D]veil shall be [G]taken [A]a[D]way.

2. Lord gain my heart so that
It is single and pure for You.
No other love, Lord would I know.
Lord I am so in love with You.
For You are so lovely,
My everything, my all in all.

3. And Lord, I really want to know
This Person inside of me.
Lord, keep my heart open to You.
Keep flowing Your life,
Into me that I would grow,
And be saturated with You.

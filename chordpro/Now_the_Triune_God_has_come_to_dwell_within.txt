1. [D]Now the Triune God has [A]come to dwell within
As the wonderful [A7]Spirit in [D]us.

As the [A]life-giving [E7]Spirit in [A]us.[A7]

2. "Abba Father" is the cry from deep within
From the wonderful Spirit in us.
'Tis the Spirit of the Son who cries to Him
As the life-giving Spirit in us.

3. Jesus Christ the Lord is living now in us
As the wonderful Spirit within.
He has been transfigured, we enjoy Him thus,
As the life-giving Spirit within.

4. Now the Spirit of reality is here
As the wonderful Spirit within.
Now the things of Christ are all so real and clear
By the life-giving Spirit within.

5. We will all stir up this gift that's deep within
As the wonderful Spirit in us.
When we call "Lord Jesus" how our spirits spring
With this life-giving Spirit in us!

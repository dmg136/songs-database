{t:I am not ashamed of the gospel}
{c:Rom. 1:16-17, 3:23-24}

1. [C]I am not a[Em]shamed of the [F]gospel,[G]
for it's the [C]power of [Em]God un[F]to salva[G]tion.
No, no, [C]no I'm not a[Em]shamed of the [F]gospel,[G]
for it's the [C]power of [Em]God un[F]to salva[G]tion.

2. To [F]everyone who [Em]believes,
to the [F]Jew first and to the [G]Greek.
For the [F]righteousness of God is [Em]revealed in it
[F]out of faith to [G]faith.

3. [F]Even as [G]it is [C]written,
"The [F]righteous shall have [G]life and [C]live,
The [F]righteous shall have [G]life and [C]live by faith,
Oh, the [F]righteous shall have [G]life and live by [C]faith."

4. [F]For all have sinned and come [Em]short,
[F]short of the glory of [G]God,
[F]being justified [Em]freely,
[F]freely by His [G]grace.

{t:Mary poured out her love offering}

1. [D][G]Mary [A]poured out her [D]love offer[Bm]ing;
To [G]many such [A]love was a [D]waste.
[G]Throughout [A]all the [D]centur[Bm]ies
Such [G]lovers Your sweetness do [A]taste.
[G]Precious [A]lives and heart [D]treasures, [Bm]too,
Po[G]sitions and [A]golden fu[D]tures
[G]Have been [A]"wasted" [D]on You, [Bm]Lord,
Your [G]sweetness-a [A]fragrance so [D]sure.

{soc}
[G]She took [A]oppor[D]tuni[Bm]ty
To [G]love You, [A]Lord, with her [D]best.
[G]Like her, [A]Lord, I [D]too would [Bm]pour
My [G]love and [A]all that I [D]have.

2. As I love You, I set my being-
My spirit, my soul, and body-
With my heart, my mind, and my strength
Absolutely on Thee.
Lord, I let my entire being
Be occupied by Thee.
As I enter in Your heart,
I sense a fellowship sweet.

{soc}
Occupied and lost in You,
My Lord, You're my everything.
Fellowship so intimate;
In spirit, Lord, I enjoy Thee.
{eoc}

3. Lord, there's none in heav'n nor on earth
That I desire but Thee.
Though my heart 'n flesh faileth, Lord,
Thou ever my portion will be.
All is vanity, all is dung!
I count all other things loss.
Everything else drains my love,
But You have captured my heart.

{soc}
Lord, I've seen Thy preciousness,
Thy worth, Thy reality.
Now, my Lord, I must confess,
My heart is only for Thee.

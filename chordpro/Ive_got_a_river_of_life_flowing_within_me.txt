{t:I've got a river of life flowing within me}

1. [D]I've got a river of [D7]life flowing [G]within [D]me;
It makes the lame to [Bm]walk and the [E7]blind to [A7]see.
It [D]opens prison [D7]doors, sets the [G]captives [D]free.
I've got a river of life [G]flowing [D]with[A7]in [D]me.

{soc}
Spring up, O well, within my spirit!
Rise up and tell, [Bm] so all can [E7]hear it![A7]
Spring up, O [D]well, so I experience
[G]That [D]life [A7] abundant[D]ly.[G][D]
{eoc}

2. I've got a river of life flowing within me;
It started gushing up when God set me free.
That I keep the flow is my only plea.
I've got a river of life springing within me.

3. Once I call His name there's a flow within;
It turns me from my day, makes Him Lord again.
As my spirit burns, Satan cannot win.
Calling, "Oh Lord Jesus," keeps the flow within.

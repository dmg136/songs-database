{t:My God, my Portion, and my Love}

1. [D]My God, my Portion, [F#m]and my Love,
My [Bm]everlasting [F#m]All,
I've [G]none but Thee in [D]heav'n above,
Or [Em]on this earthly [A]ball.

2. What [D]empty things are [F#m]all the skies,
And [Bm]this inferior [F#m]clod!
There's [G]nothing here de[D]serves my joys,
There's [Em]nothing [A]like my [D]God.

3. To Thee I owe my wealth, and friends,
And health, and safe abode;
Thanks to Thy name for meaner things,
But they are not my God.

4. How vain a toy is glittering wealth,
If once compared to Thee!
Or what's my safety, or my health,
Or all my friends to me.

5. Were I possessor of the earth,
And called the stars my own,
Without Thy graces and Thyself,
I were a wretch undone.

6. Let others stretch their arms like seas,
And grasp in all the shore;
Grant me the visits of Thy grace,
And I desire no more.

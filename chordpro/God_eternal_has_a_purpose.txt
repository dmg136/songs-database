{t:God eternal has a purpose}

1. [G]God e[D]ternal [Em]has a [D]purpose,
[G]Formed in [D]His e[Em]ternal [D]past,
[G]Spreading [D]to e[Em]ternal [D]future;
[G]'Twixt these [D]ends all [Em]time is [D]cast.
[C]For with time there is the [G]process,
[C]Time for His accomplish[G]ment;
[C]And in time we're merely [G]travelers—
[C]For eternity we're [G]meant.

2. God would have a group of people
Built together in His plan,
Blended, knit, coordinated
As His vessel—one new man.
God would come into this vessel
With His nature, life and ways,
Mingling Spirit with our spirits
For His joy and to His praise.

3. God has worked in three directions
For His plan so marvelous:
As the Father, Son, and Spirit
To dispense Himself to us!
All creation gives the setting—
Heav'n and earth are for this plan;
'Tis for this God made a body,
Soul and spirit—three-part man.

4. As the center, as the kernel,
Of God's plan our spirit is;
Calling on the name of Jesus
Makes our spirit one with His.
From the center to circumference
God would saturate each part;
Feeling, mind, and will renewing,
Making home in all our heart.

5. Thus in life we're built together,
Then in love we're knit as one;
God is now His plan fulfilling,
Finishing what He's begun.
Lord, increase Thyself within us
That we might be built by Thee
Into that great corporate vessel
Filled with God exclusively.

6. As the product, the fulfillment,
Will the church in glory stand,
Consummation of the purpose
In eternal ages planned.
God will have His corporate vessel,
All His glory to contain;
Lord, we're wholly for Thy purpose
All Thy goal in us attain.

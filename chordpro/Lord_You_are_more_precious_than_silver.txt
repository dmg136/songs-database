{t:Lord, You are more precious than silver}

1. [D]Lord, You [A]are more [G]precious than [D]silver;
Lord, You [A]are more [G]costly than [A]gold;
[D]Lord, You [A]are more [G]beautiful than [D]diamonds;
And [G]nothing I de[A]sire compares with [D]You.

2. Lord, Your life is divine, eternal.
Lord, Your life regenerated me.
Lord, Your life is growing within me,
Until I am fully conformed to Thee.

3. Lord, Your love is wide as the ocean.
Lord, Your love is deep as the sea.
Lord, Your love encompasses the nations,
And that is all I want to live in me.

4. Lord, Your light is shining within us;
Lord, Your light drives darkness away.
Lord, Your light is guiding us onwards,
Preparing us for the coming wedding day.

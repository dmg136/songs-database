{t:Now from my heart comes}

1. [A]Now from my heart comes,
A happy song;
It's just for You, Lord,[A7]
There's only One:
[D]J-E-S-U-[E]S, I love [A]You.[A7]

{soc}
[D]How I long to sing
With my [E]spirit and heart to You.
[C#m]Jesus, You're so rich;
In who You [F#]are and what You do.
[Bm]Ev'ry time I turn and open [E]up,
I drink of You.
'Cause I [A]love You.[E][A]
{eoc}

2. I've seen how they,
Pierced Your side,
You gave Your all,
To win Your bride
J-E-S-U-S, I love You.

3. Without Your love, Lord,
I'm so empty
Life has no meaning;
Just vanity,
J-E-S-U-S, Reality.

4. Jesus in me.
What a wonder;
Bubbling over,
Living water.
J-E-S-U-S, What a joy!

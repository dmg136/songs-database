{t:Whither shall I go from Thy Spirit}

{soc}
[D]Whither shall I[F#m][G] go [A]from Thy [D]Spirit?[F#m][G][A]
And [D]whither shall I[F#m][G] flee [A]from Thy [D]presence?[F#m][G][A]
{eoc}

1. If [Bm]I as[F#m]cend up into the [G]heavens
Thou art [A]there;
Or if I [Bm]make my [F#m]bed in [G]Sheol, be[A]hold,
Thou art [D]there;

2. If I take the wings of the dawn and dwell 
In the uttermost parts of the sea, behold,
Thou art there;

3. Even there shall Thy hand lead me,
And even there Thy right hand shall hold me,
Behold, Thou art there.

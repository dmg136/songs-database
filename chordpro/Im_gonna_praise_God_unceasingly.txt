2. Now I live by the tree of life,
His fruit does nourish me,
O, how it strengthens me,
I'll live eternally.
Now I live by the tree of life,
Him daily I apply,
He is my food supply.

3. There's a river of life in me,
Flowing so livingly,
Moving continually,
He just keeps flooding me.
There's a river of life in me,
He's always filling me,
His name is Jesus Christ!

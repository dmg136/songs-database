{t:Never did I dream before}

1. [D]Never [A]did I dream be[D]fore,
[G]Such a [A]place could e'er be [D]found,
Where the [A]tears of sorrow [D]cease,
[G]Songs of [A]endless joy [D]abound.
One who [G]seldom ever [D]sang,[Bm]
[G]Now delights his voice to [A]raise;
Singing [G]hymns with all the [D]saints,[Bm]
[Em]Echo[A7]ing the ceaseless [D]praise.

2. Day by day the world goes on,
Just as it has gone before.
Millions grasp and clutch at life,
Wond'ring if there could be more;
Such was I and would be, yet
Mercy found me out somehow;
With what gratefulness I say,
"I'm in God's own family now."

3. How delightful 'tis to know;
How subjective, real, and sweet
Is this inward joy of grace
We experience when we meet;
Life abundant Jesus gives
As my full reality;
Praise You, Lord, it's really true,
I'm in Your own family.

4. At the closing of this age,
Just before Your kingdom's dawn,
May You gain a people, Lord,
For Your dwelling place, Your home.
Since for me You gave Your all,
Everything I lay aside;
For Your church my all I'd give,
That You would be satisfied.

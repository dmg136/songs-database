{t:What things were gains to me}

1. [D]What things were gains to me,
[Bm]These I now [G]count as [A]loss.
[D]Jesus has set me free
[Bm]From what I [A]was!
[D]All of the things I had;
[Bm]Everything, [G]good or [A]bad,
[D]I count as refuse
That [A]I may gain [D]Christ!

{soc}
I won't give [A]up!
[D]I will keep [G]running until
[D]I have [G]attained
The goal of my [A]calling!
[D]I will press [A]on!
[D]I will pur[G]sue until
I [D]lay hold of [G]Him
Who [A]laid hold of [D]me!
{eoc}

2. Forget the things behind!
Stretch for the things before!
Press onward with this mind:
Always want more!
Seeking in Him to grow,
Increasingly to know
Him that I daily might
Be found in Christ.

{t:Fallen, that's the way we all begin}

1. [D]Fallen, [G]that's the way we [A]all be[D]gin:
Imprisoned [G]by the evil [A]fate we're in.
[D] How can [G]we from this hard [A]world of [D]sin be [A]saved?[A7]

{soc}
Just by [D]calling, [G]"Jesus, [A7]Jesus, Je[D]sus."
[G]Every mo[A]ment, each [D]day!
[G]Calling on the [A]name of [D]Jesus—
We're [G]find[F#m]ing [Em]is [E7]the [A]way.
[D]It's [G]Je[D]sus, Lord [G]Je[D]sus!
{eoc}

2. Still times, though we love the Lord so much,
Somehow, it seems we get out of touch
With Jesus. How can we be freed from such distress?

3. Sometimes we know we aren't being real.
Then times, we just live by how we feel.
Is there some way we could ever deal with self?

4. Christians, scattered throughout all the earth
Are wond’ring, “Where is the pearl of great worth?”
How can all those of the second birth be one?

5. Calling, you’ll find this will fill your lack,
And calling's going to bring the Bridegroom back.
Why not stand upon this glorious fact today?

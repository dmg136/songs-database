{t:Behold the New Jerusalem descends from God}

[G]Behold the New Je[Em]rusalem des[Am]cends from [D]God.
The [G]Triune God Him[Em]self in His in[Am]trinsic [D]essence
Now [G]consummately [G7]dwells in them and [C]they in [Cm]Him.
Be[G]hold the New Je[Em]rusalem des[Am]cends from [D]God.
Il[G]lumined by the [Em]light of life they [Am]walk the [D]way—
Of [G]life, and eat the [Em]tree of life and [Am]drink the [D]river.
And [G]thus enjoying [G7]God fore'er, they're [C]one with [Cm]Him,
As the [G]very processed [Em]Triune God dis[Am]penses Him[D]self to [G]them.

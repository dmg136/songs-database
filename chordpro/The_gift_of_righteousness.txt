{t:The gift of righteousness}

1. [C]The gift of righteousness [D]is measured in a[C]bun[G]dance,
The [C]depth of His love I'll [D]never under[G]stand.
His [C]love reaches me and [D]you;
His [G]mercy goes farther [Em]too.
The [C]One on the throne of [D7]God is called the [G]Lamb.

{soc}
So, why not [C]open up and [D]call His name, "Oh [G]Lord!"
Find your [C]spirit where His [D]grace has been out[G]poured.
Call His [C]name, taste His [D]grace, exer[G]cise before His [Em]face
He's longing and [G]yearning.
He's [C]hoping and [G]waiting.
He's [C]ever de[G]siring for [D]you...
To turn to [G]Him.

2. He knows your deepest thought, your every situation.
He understands your heart, He knows your history.
There's nothing in His way,
He's just waiting for you to say
"Lord Jesus, my wandering heart I give to Thee."

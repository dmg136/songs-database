{t:There are times and times again}
{c: Capo 2}

1. [D]There are [Bm]times and times again,[G]
When my [A]love seems far [D]away;
The hours would [Bm]stretch, the days turn [G]gray;[A]
[D]All the [Bm]while, I know not how,[G]
In my [A]darkest hour, He prays[D]
In the [Bm]saints, oh, for my sake.[A]

{soc}
[G]By a [A]touch of His dear [D]love,[Bm]
[G]By the [A]sound of His sweet [D]voice,
Whispers from above,[G]
Spoken [A]through men of [Bm]clay.
And this [G]world just fades away.[D][Bm][G][A]
(Let this world just fade away.[D])
{eoc}

2. Blinded soul, I cannot see
What this world has done to me;
My heart grows cold and life would bleed;
Then He comes, knocks on my door,
Through the saintsâ€”and there they stand
With the Lord, oh, for my need!

{t:Lord, You are Beloved, Fairest of the fair}

1. [C]Lord, You are Be[Am]loved, [F]Fairest of the [G]fair;
[C]Altogether [Am]lovely, un[F]rivaled [G]beauty;
[F]It's You! Your [C]presence, I [F] long for and [C]seek;
[G]You're the One [Am]in Whom my [F]heart delights,
So, [G]I just love to tell You...

{soc}
[C]Jesus, I [F]love You,
My [C]treasure, You [F]are;
[Am]How could I choose [G]anything [C]less than [F]You?
Dear [C]Lord, my in[Am]most heart
You've [G]captured and [C]won.

2. Dead I was in sin Lord, so lost without You;
Helpless, wounded, weary, rebellious, too;
But Lord, You came! You would not let me go;
The blood and water flowed from Your side,
Constraining me to tell You...

3. Thank You Lord, You opened my blind eyes to see
I was lame, but now I can walk; You healed me!
My leprosy, Lord, You cleansed all away;
My ears were opened to hear Your voice,
And now I follow You 'cause...

4. Sometimes Lord, I'm drawn off by my selfish cares;
And the world it draws me with glitter and glare.
O Lord, You've trapped me. Don't let me go.
Kiss me and woo me, and win my heart,
So, I will always tell You...

5. Keep my heart so soft, Lord, so open to You;
It would be the good ground to bear fruit for You;
Capture my friends Lord, and build us, I pray;
Your Bride, We'd match You in every way,
And corporately we tell You:

{soc}
Jesus, Come quickly,
We're waiting for You;
We're the virgins to You,
So single and true;
Forever and ever
Your counterpart true.

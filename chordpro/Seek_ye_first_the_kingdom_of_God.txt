{t:Seek ye first the kingdom of God}
{c:Matt. 4:4, 6:33, 7:7}

1. [D]Seek ye [F#m]first the [G]kingdom of [D]God
[G]And His [D]righteous[A]ness;[A7]
[D]And all these [F#m]things shall be [G]added unto [D]you.
[G]Halle[D]lu, Halle[A]lu[D]jah!

2. Ask, and it shall be given unto you;
Seek, and you shall find.
Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.
Hallelu, Hallelujah!

3. Man shall not live by bread alone,
But by every word
That proceeds out from the mouth of God.
Hallelu, Hallelujah!

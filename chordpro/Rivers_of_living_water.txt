{t:Rivers of living water}

1. [C]Ri[G]vers of [F]living [G]water,
[C]Ri[G]vers that [Dm]flow from the [G]throne,
[F]Ri[C]vers o'er[Am]flowing with [G]blessing,
[F]Com[C]ing from [Dm]Jesus a[G]lone.

{soc}
[C]Ri[F]vers of [G]living [C]wa[G]ter,
[Am]Ri[Em]vers of [F]life so [G]free,
[C]Flow[F]ing from [G]Thee, my [C]Sa[G]vior,
[Am]Send [G]now this [F]life through [G]me.
{eoc}

2. Whoso is thirsty come hither,
Here is abundant supply;
Water transparent as crystal,
Come without money and buy.

3. Cleanse me, oh, cleanse me, my Savior,
Make me a channel today;
Empty me, fill me and use me,
Teach me to trust and obey.

4. Then, and then only, Lord Jesus,
Through me the rivers can flow;
Thus and thus only will others
Learn Thy great fulness to know.

5. Now I surrender to Jesus,
Here I lay all at His feet;
Anything, anywhere only,
Just for His service made meet!

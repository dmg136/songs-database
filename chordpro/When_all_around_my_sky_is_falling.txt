{t:When all around my sky is falling}
{c:Capo 3}

1. [D]When all around my [Bm]sky is falling
[G]And fear and doubt run [A]deep in my heart,
[D]It's in these times I'm [Bm]on You calling,
[G]Opening to You, Lord, [A]my deepest part.

{soc}
[D]Oh, Lord [Bm]Jesus!
[G]How I [A]love You!
[D]And I [Bm]need You
[G]All the [A]time.
[D]Ahh, to [Bm]touch You
[G]In my [A]weakness,
[D]And to [Bm]hold You,
[A]Savior [D]mine.
{eoc}

2. Lord, by Your mercy You consume me.
It's all according to God's plan.
By resurrection life renew me,
Day by day, my inner man.

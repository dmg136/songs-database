I want to seek You constantly
So you can spread through me.

Open to you; I have no shame
Loving You, Jesus Lord.

Be so real to me.
You are all I want;
I open wide to Thee.

Open my eyes that I might see
All that You are to me.
Just let me enter in Your heart,
Never from You would I depart,
Loving You constantly.

Flood me thoroughly;
Take my willing heart
And overcome in me.

Save me from being Satan's prey,
I am believing You.
All I can give to You, my Lord,
Is my whole being, love outpoured;
Lord, I belong to You.

Jesus, faithful God,
Gain us through and through;
Use us thoroughly
To see Your purpose through.

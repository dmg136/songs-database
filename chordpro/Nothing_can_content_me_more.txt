{t:Nothing can content me more}
{c:Capo 1}

1. [D]Nothing can con[A]tent me more,
Than [Bm]Jesus in the morning,
[G]Echoing the [A]hallways of my [D]heart.[A7]
My [D]eyes from darkness clearly see,
The [Bm]love within His smile, for me.
[G]It's then I know the [A]reason for my [D]life.

{soc}
[G]Jesus, [A]You're my reason [D] for being [Bm]here,
[D]Oh, it's so [Bm]clear; so I [E7]sing![A]
{eoc}

2. No greater joy can be for me,
Than turning to Jesus,
When the shadows of the day begin to haunt me.
His soft, warm Spirit spreads throughout,
Quenching all my fear and doubt.
Jesus is the all-inclusive love.

3. (Repeat verse 2 after chorus)

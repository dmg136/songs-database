{t:Calling, O Lord Jesus}
{c: Capo 3}

[D]Calling, "O Lord Jesus!"
Oh, it makes our spirit [A]strong!
[Em]We can really touch Him,
[A7]And our gloom is turned to [D]song!
Don't listen to Satan, with [D7]all His distractions;
[G]Turn to your spirit, [Gm]spring into action!
[D]Calling, "O Lord [Bm]Jesus!"
[Em]You'll enjoy Him [A7]all day [G]long![D]

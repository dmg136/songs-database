{t:Though I love You, Lord}

1. [C]Though I love You, [Em]Lord,[Am]
My life seems [F]all deformed.[C]
I give my life to [Em]You—[Am]
Then drift [F]away.[C]
Lord, may I [G]ask You that You'd [Em]draw me yet [F]again,[C]
And keep me [G]running after [C]You.

{soc}
[F] Lord, I've seen Your purpose.
[C] Your heart's unveiled to me.
[G] Now I'd just like to see You [F]gain me fully.
Though You I often limit
[C] And fail by compromise,
[G] Keep me in the index of Your [F]eyes.[G][C]
{eoc}

2. Lord, I want Your best.
I want Your full blessing.
I don't want any less,
Though good it be.
Have mercy, Lord, to push, to pull, lay hold of me.
Keep me still running toward the prize.

3. Mold me, shape me, Lord.
Be my reality.
Even break my heart,
If it has to be.
I'm desperate, Lord, that You would have Your way with me.
Others could touch You then through me.

4. Set my heart aflame.
Don't let me stay the same.
Don't let things remain
Which now grieve You.
My life I give to You and all I've claimed as mine.
May I just hold, Lord, unto You.

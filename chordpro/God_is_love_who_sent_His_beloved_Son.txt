2. Who can know the love from our Father's being?
Ears have never heard, eyes have never seen,
But Lord, I've been redeemed.
God is love. O God, a man You became;
A cursed man to be, God, You died for me.
Lord, You hung from a tree.

{soc}
Father, You have sent Him,
Your beloved Son.
He shed His blood on Calvary.
Your love reached me.
{eoc}

Just believe in Him. Be not perishing,
But have eternal life.
Just believe in Him. Be not perishing,

{t:Dearest Lord, You've called us here}
{c: Capo 3}

1. [D] Dearest Lord, You've [Bm]called us here,
And [G]opened up Your [A]heart.
[D] O the joy to [Bm]hear Your call
And [G]enter in the [A]Ark.
[D] Saving us from [Bm]day to day
O [G]Lord, this is Your [A]way.
[D] In Yourself we [Bm]stay afloat,
[G]Above this wicked [A]age to[D]day.[D7]

{soc}
[G] Thank You [A]Lord, in Your [D]eyes we find [Bm]grace,
[G] And with open [A]hearts we come to [D]You.[D7]
[G] Regardless [A]what our friends might [D]say to us or [Bm]do,
[G] O Lord [A]Jesus, we love [D]You.
{eoc}

2. Seeking of this age to taste,
And of it have a part.
If we only knew, dear Lord,
The ways we grieve Your heart.
We would come and turn to You
With a repenting heart,
And would give ourselves to be
With you, O Lord, inside the Ark.

3. Praise You Lord, we're safe in You;
Outside death-waters pour.
Many things that I once loved
Are on the ocean floor.
Keep us open to You Lord,
Don't let us miss the mark.
Hallelujah, praise the Lord,
We're here within the church, the Ark.

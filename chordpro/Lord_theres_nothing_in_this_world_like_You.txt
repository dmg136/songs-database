{t:Lord, there's nothing in this world like You}

{soc}
[D]Lord, [DM7] there's nothing [G]in this world like [Em]You;
You [D]fill me up com[A]pletely.
And [D]I would never [DM7]give You up for [G]anything
Be[Em]cause [E7]nothing else could satisfy me [A]so.[A7]
{eoc}

1. [D]People think that [DM7]they can find
[G]Satisfaction, [Gm]peace of mind.
[D]Everything leads [Bm]to another,
[Em]But I've found the [A7]best.

2. No more trying something else,
Or thinking that there's something more;
No more hoping "someday,"
'Cause today I have the best.

3. Looking not at failures past,
Hoping not in future dreams;
Not wishing I were different,
Knowing everything's the best.

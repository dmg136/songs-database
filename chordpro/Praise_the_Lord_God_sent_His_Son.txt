2. For us He was crucified,
Hallelujah!
For the many, one Man died,
Glory to God!
One grain fell into the earth,
Many grains to bring to birth.

3. He arose in victory,
Hallelujah!
From the grave, triumphantly,
Glory to God!
Now in resurrection He
As the Spirit lives in me.

4. Call on Him from deep within,
Hallelujah!
Just by calling, He comes in,
Glory to God!
Once you call upon His name,
Nevermore you'll be the same.

{soc}
We all must call on Him,
We give our all to Him.

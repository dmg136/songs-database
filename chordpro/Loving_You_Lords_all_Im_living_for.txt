2. You've the right to take all that I love,
But replace it with Yourself much more.
You are what I need, give Yourself to me,
Do not give all that I want.
Everything is sure to pass away,
Everyone is going their own way.
But I still have You and You have me too,
Loving one another's sweet.

3. I treasure my time alone with You,
Just to gain the best love You long for.
My dearest Husband, draw me with Yourself
Into Your chambers right now.
Be the first in all my work and life,
Be the first in all my service too.
In relationships, You must be the first;
Have preeminence in me.

{t:Every new day's a new start}
{c: Capo 3}

1. [D]Every new day's a new [A]start.
[Em]Lord, again we're [A]coming to [D]You.
Lord, could You ever break [G]through within us
[D]If, Lord, we gave You a [A]part?

{soc}
O [G]Lord, we can't do it on [A]our own.
O Lord Jesus, how we need [D]You!
Win us, woo us, [G]to Thyself, Lord,
[D]That we'd ever [A]stay, Lord, with [D]You.
{eoc}

2. Lord, before time had begun,
We were marked and called out by You.
We had no choice, we were trapped by You, Lord;
We had no place we could run.

3. Some of my friends are so free.
Who could I blame, Lord, but Thee?
I cannot do all the things that they do
Because You set me apart.

4. Lord, I'm realizing that
Loving You's a tender trap.
Since You have kissed me, my heart has melted;
All my resistance has cracked.

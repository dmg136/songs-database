{t:Rise up, my love}
{c:Song of Songs 2:10-12}

[C]Rise up, my [F]love, my [C]beautiful one,
And come a[Am]way, for be[Em]hold, the winter is [Dm]past,
The [F]rain is [G7]over and [C]gone.
Flow'rs appear on the [F]earth,
The [C]time of singing has come,
And the [Am]voice of the [Em]turtle [Dm]dove
Is [F]heard [G7]in our [C]land.

My be[F]loved is [G7]mine,
And [Am]I am [F]His,
He who [Dm]feeds the [G7]flocks among the [C]lilies.[C7]
'Til the [F]day [Dm]breaks,
And the [E]shadows flee a[Am]way,
Come my be[F]lo[Dm]ved,
Come my be[G]loved!

Rise [C]up, my [F]love, my [C]beautiful one
And come a[Am]way, for be[Em]hold, the winter is [Dm]past,
The [F]rain is [G7]over and [C]gone.

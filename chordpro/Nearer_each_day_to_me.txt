{t:Nearer each day to me}

1. [G]Nearer each [C]day [CM7]to [Am7]me; 
[D]Dearer each [G]day [Bm7]to [Em]me;
This Person in[C]side [CM7]me [Am7]is
Be[D]coming re[G]a[B7]li[Em]ty,
Saving me, [C]lov[CM7]ing [Am7]me,
[D]Faith and hope [G]gi[B7]ving [Em]me.
You're all the [Am]world [Am7]to [D]me,
[D7]Jesus, my [G]Lord![C][G]

2. Even when faith is small,
When there's no hope at all,
I hear Him say to me,
"Trust in Me and you'll see
That I'll supply all your needs
If only you will believe.
All anxious doubts will cease
While trusting in Me!"

3. Thank You for being here
Whenever I choose to turn and draw near.
Your arms are open wide,
Whispering, "Just abide."
I cannot live by me.
Please show me until I see
That I need nothing more
Than Jesus, my Lord.

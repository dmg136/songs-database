{t:But if I delay}

1. [D]But if I de[Bm]lay,
I [G]write that you may [A]know
How one ought [D]to con[Bm]duct
Him[G]self in the house of [A]God,
Which [D]is the [Bm]church,
The [G]church of the living [A]God,
The [D]pillar and [Bm]base,
The [G]pillar and [A]base of the [D]truth.

{soc}
And con[G]fessed[A]ly,
[F#m]Great is the myste[Bm]ry,
The [G]myste[A]ry of [D]godli[D7]ness:
And con[G]fessed[A]ly,
[F#m]Great is the myste[Bm]ry,
The [G]myste[A]ry of godli[D]ness.

2. [G]He who was [A]mani[F#m]fested in the [Bm]flesh,
[G]Justi[A]fied in the [D]spi[D7]rit,
[G]Seen by [A]angels,
[F#m]Preached among the [Bm]nations,
Be[G]lieved on in the [A]world,
Taken [D]up in glory.

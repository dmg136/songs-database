{t:We will sing to the Lord with our spirit}

1. [G]We will sing to the Lord with our spirit,
We will sing to the Lord from with[D7]in,
We will [G]sing halle[G7]lujah to [C]Jesus;[Am]
And be [G]blent into [D7]oneness with [G]Him.[C][G]

2. We have been many years in religion,
We have been many years in our mind,
We have been many years in emotions,
Always seeking, but never to find.

3. Now we're learning to turn to our spirit,
Now we're learning to take Christ as life;
Now we're learning to feed upon Jesus
And be freed from all struggling and strife.

4. Hallelujah for life in the Spirit,
Hallelujah for newness within.
When we turn from our mind to our spirit,
We enjoy all the riches of Him.

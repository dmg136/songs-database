[D]Read[A]ing the [D]Bible—
[G]I love the [A]Word of [D]God![A]
[D]Read[A]ing the [D]Bible—
[G]I love the [A]Word of [D]God!

1. Every verse re[A]veals Your[D]self to me,
Every [G]line con[A]veys re[D]ality.[A]
When I [D]pray the [A]words that [D]You breathed out
You be[G]come so [A]real to [D]me.

2. As I read, I pray, as I pray, I read,
Mingling both as one spontaneously.
You respond within with words so sweet,
I repeat these words to Thee.

3. I'm a newborn babe—it's the milk I need,
Not the knowledge of the dead teaching.
When I eat Your word, it becomes to me
My heart's joy and rejoicing.

4. Sweeter than honey, precious more than gold;
It will not be void, but as the rain and snow,
It will do Your will—bear the life divine,
Bearing fruit a hundred-fold.

5. When my heart is like a rock so cold,
It's Your word so strong that hammers stone,
That the grain of life may come to me
And supply me inwardly.

6. It's my food, my drink, and my life supply;
I love to eat it every day and night.
I just turn and open up to Him,
And the rivers flow right in.

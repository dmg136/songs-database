{t:I have fought the good fight}
{c:2 Tim. 4:7-8}

1. [C]I have fought the [Am]good fight;
[F]I have finished the [G]course;
[C]I have fought the [Am]good fight;
[F]I have kept the [G]faith.

2. [Em]Hence[Am]forth there is [F]laid up for [G]me
The crown of [Em]righteous[Am]ness,
Which the [F]Lord, the Righteous [G]Judge,
Will recom[Em]pense me in that [Am]day,
And [F]not only [G]me
But also [Em]all [Am]those who [F]have [G]loved His ap[C]pearing.

{t:Once it was the blessing}

1. [C]Once it [G]was the [Am]bles[F]sing,
[C]Now it [G]is the [C]Lord;[G]
[C]Once it [G]was the [Am]feel[F]ing,
[C]Now it [G]is His [C]Word;
[F]Once His [C]gift I [G]want[C]ed,
[F]Now, the [C]Giver [G]own;
[C]Once I [G]sought for [Am]heal[F]ing,
[C]Now Him[G]self a[C]lone.

{soc}
[F]All in [C]all for[G]e[C]ver,
[F]Only [C]Christ I'll [G]sing;
[C]Every[G]thing is [Am]in [F]Christ,
And [C]Christ is [G]every[C]thing.

2. Once 'twas painful trying,
Now 'tis perfect trust;
Once a half salvation,
Now the uttermost;
Once 'twas ceaseless holding,
Now He holds me fast;
Once 'twas constant drifting,
Now my anchor's cast.

3. Once 'twas busy planning,
Now 'tis trustful prayer;
Once 'twas anxious caring,
Now He has the care;
Once 'twas what I wanted,
Now what Jesus says;
Once 'twas constant asking,
Now 'tis ceaseless praise.

4. Once it was my working,
His it hence shall be;
Once I tried to use Him,
Now He uses me;
Once the pow'r I wanted,
Now the Mighty One;
Once for self I labored,
Now for Him alone.

5. Once I hoped in Jesus,
Now I know He's mine;
Once my lamps were dying,
Now they brightly shine;
Once for death I waited,
Now His coming hail;
And my hopes are anchored
Safe within the veil.

{t:There is a great mystery}

1. [D]There is a great mystery,
A wonderful [F#m]story;
For ages 'twas [G]hidden,
Now shown in His [A]wisdom;[A7]
'Tis a divine [D]romance
Of God and man [F#m]in time;
Beyond under[G]standing,
Yet seen in God's [A7]speaking.

{soc}
God fell in love [D]with man;
For only God's [Bm]love can
Make man just the [G]same as He
In life and in [A]nature.[A7]
We are His ex[D]pression,
His bride, His en[Bm]largement;
Forever, to[G]gether,
As living, in[D]sep'rable as one [A]couple[A7]
Eternal[D]ly.

2. Though He was rejected
By men who were blinded;
His love is constraining,
His heart still unchanging;
Thus in incarnation
Came He as salvation;
His name is called Jesus,
And He came to seek us.

3. Though born as a sinner,
His blood has redeemed me.
He suffered on Calv'ry,
Then raised up in glory,
To regenerate me.
Now joined in one spirit
I love to enjoy Him,
For I've been forgiven!

4. His love is so tender,
To Him I'll surrender;
His name is so precious,
I gladly call, "Jesus!"
His Person's so charming,
My heart ever winning;
I'll hold back no longer,
I'll love Him forever.

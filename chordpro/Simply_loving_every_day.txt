{t:Simply loving every day}
{c: Hymns, #569}

1. [D]Simply loving every [DM7]day;
[Em]Loving [A]through a stormy [D]way;
Even when my faith is [Em]small,[A]
Loving [G]Jesus, that is [D]all.

{soc}
Loving as the moments [DM7]fly,
[Em]Loving [A]as the days go [D]by,
Loving Him, whate'er [Em]befall,[A]
Loving [G]Jesus, that is [D]all.
{eoc}

2. Brightly doth His Spirit shine
Into this poor heart of mine;
While He leads I cannot fall,
Loving Jesus, that is all.

3. Singing if my way be clear,
Praying if the path be drear;
While He leads I cannot fall,
Loving Jesus, that is all.

4. Loving Him while life shall last,
Loving Him 'til earth is past,
'Til His gracious advent call,
Loving Jesus, that is all.

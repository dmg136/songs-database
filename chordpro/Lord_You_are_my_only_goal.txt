{t:Lord, You are my only goal}
{c:Capo 2}

1. [G]Lord, You [B7]are my only [Em]goal!
You're [C]my only [D]hope!
I only [G]care [B7]for [Em]You!
I [C]never could re[D]place You,
And [G]I would never [Em]want to.
[C]I have every[D]thing, Lord—
I have [G]You!

2. Lord, I only live for You—
Not anything else!
In everything You're my source;
No more good intentions,
No more right or wrong.
I don't want a "good" life—
I want You!

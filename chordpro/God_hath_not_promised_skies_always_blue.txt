{c:Capo 3}

1. [Bm]God hath not prom[G]ised skies always [D]blue,[A]
[Bm] Flower-strewn [G]pathways all our lives [D]through;[A]
[F#m] God hath not prom[G]ised sun without [D]ra[A]in,[G]
Joy without [D]sorrow,[A] peace without [G]pain.[D]

{soc}
[C] But God hath prom[G]ised strength for the [D]day,
[C] Rest for the la[G]bor, [Em]light for the [A]way,
[F#m] Grace for the tri[G]als, help from a[Bm]bo[A]ve,[G]
Unfailing [D]sympathy,[A] undying [G]love.[D]
{eoc}

2. God hath not promised we shall not know
Toil and temptation, trouble and woe;
He hath not told us we shall not bear
Many a burden, many a care.

3. God hath not promised smooth roads and wide,
Swift, easy travel, needing no guide;
Never a mountain, rocky and steep,
Never a river, turbid and deep.

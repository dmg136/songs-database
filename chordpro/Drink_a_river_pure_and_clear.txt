{t:Drink! A river pure and clear}

1. [G]Drink! A river pure and clear that's flowing from the throne;
[C]Eat! The tree of life with fruits abundant, richly [G]grown;
Look! No need of lamp nor sun nor moon to keep it [Em]bright, for
[G]Here there [D7]is no [G]night!

{soc}
Do come, oh, do come,
Says Spirit and the [G7]Bride:
[C]Do come, oh, do come,
Let him that heareth, [G]cry.
Do come, oh, do come,
Let [B7]him who thirsts and [Em]will
Take [G]freely the [D]water of [G]life!
{eoc}

2. Christ, our river, Christ, our water, springing from within;
Christ, our tree, and Christ, the fruits, to be enjoyed therein,
Christ, our day, and Christ, our light, and Christ, our morningstar:
Christ, our everything!

3. We are washing all our robes the tree of life to eat;
"O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!"—Jesus is so sweet!
We our spirits exercise, and thus experience Christ.
What a Christ have we!

4. Now we have a home so bright that outshines the sun,
Where the brothers all unite and truly are one.
Jesus gets us all together, Him we now display
In the local church.

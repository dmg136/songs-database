{t:I've given up the world because}

1. [G]I've given up the world because
[C]I've found something more:
He's [G]better than anything
I've [D]ever found be[D7]fore.
Yes, [G]I have found the Living One,
Oh, [C]how my spirit soars!
I [D]called His name, I'm [D7]not the same,
I am for the [G]Lord!

{soc}
I'm for the [C]Lord!
I'm loving [G]Jesus!
I'm for the [C]Lord!
I'm calling [D]O Lord Je[G]sus![C][G][C][G][C][G]

2. I've given up the world because
I've found something better:
I have found the Living One
And He breaks every fetter.
Yes, He's the One who set me free.
Oh, how my spirit soars!
I called His name, I'm not the same,
I am for the Lord!

3. And now I'm really happy,
Yes I'm fully satisfied.
I have found the Living One,
And He lives right inside
Of you and me, so come and see
Now our spirits soar!
We called His name, we're not the same,
We are for the Lord!

{soc}
We're for the Lord!
We're loving Jesus!
We're for the Lord!
We're calling O Lord Jesus!

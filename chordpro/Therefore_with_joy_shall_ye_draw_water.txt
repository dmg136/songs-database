{t:Therefore with joy shall ye draw water}
{c:Isa. 12:3-4, 6}

[A]There[E7]fore with [A]joy shall [E]ye draw [A]water
Out of the wells [A7]of sal[D]vation.
And in that [A]day shall ye [F#m]say,
Praise the [B7]Lord.[E7]

Therefore with [A]joy shall [E]ye draw [A]water
Out of the wells [A7]of sal[D]vation.
And in that [A]day[F#m] shall ye [E]say,
[E7]Praise the [A]Lord.[A7]

[D]Call upon His name,
Declare His doings among the [A]people,
Make [B7]mention that His name is e[E7]xalted.
Cry out and [A]shout, thou in[A7]habitant of [D]Zion:
For great is the [E]Holy One of [E7]Israel in the midst of [A]thee.

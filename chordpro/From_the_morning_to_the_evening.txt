{t:From the morning to the evening}
{c: Capo 1}

1. [D] From the morning to the [A]evening, [Bm] His faithfulness I [G]see;
[D] His mercy reaching [A]sinners, [F#m] reaching even [G]me;
And I [Em]know, now I [A]know.
[D] Brighter than the brightest [A]sunlight, [Bm] all doubts and fears must [G]cease;
[D] Sweeter than the sweetest [A]delight, [F#m] His living Word in [G]me;
And I [Em]know, now I [A]know.

{soc}
That God is [D]there for me to[F#m]morrow,
As He [G]is for me to[A]day;
That He'll [D]take my cares and [F#m]sorrow,
And He'll [G]wipe them all a[A]way;
There's no [D]crisis that He [F#m]can't bear,
There's no [G]storm He can't a[A]bate;
He's my [G]God,[A] He's my [D]God.
{eoc}

2. Day by day His grace grows dearer; His love has conquered me,
Never leaving, never ceasing, His Spirit constantly
Flooding me, rich and free;
Higher than the highest heaven, He lifts me up to see
New Jerusalem descending, His Bride, His love to be
Eternally, it shall be.

{t:Have you found your human spirit}

1. [G]Have you [C]found your human [G]spirit?
[C]It's connected to your [G]mouth!
"Hallelujah, O Lord [C]Jesus!"
[G]That's the way to [D7]let it [G]out.

{soc}
What is born of God is [C]our human [G]spirit—
[Em]Praise God, the [A7]job has been [D]done![D7]
What is [G]born of Spirit [C]is just our [G]spirit,
And the two [D7]spirits are [G]one.[C][G]
{eoc}

2. Don't wait for an inspiration—
That's the subtle enemy.
Open up! Release your spirit,
Testifying you are free.

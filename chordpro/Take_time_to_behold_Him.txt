{t:Take time to behold Him}
{c:Capo 3}

1. [D]Take time to be[Bm]hold Him,
Speak [G]oft with Thy [A]Lord,
[D]Abide in Him [Bm]always,
And [G]feed on His [A]Word.
Wait [Bm]thou in His pre[F#m]sence,
Sub[G]missive and [A]meek,
For[D]getting in [Bm]nothing
His [G]bless[A]ing to [D]seek.

2. Take time to behold Him,
The world rushes on;
Spend much time in secret
With Jesus alone.
By looking to Jesus
Like Him thou shalt be;
Thy friends, in thy conduct,
His likeness shall see.

3. Take time to behold Him,
Let Him be thy guide;
And run not before Him
Whatever betide;
In joy or in sorrow
Still follow thy Lord,
And, looking to Jesus,
Still trust in His Word.

4. Take time to behold Him,
Be calm in thy soul,
Each thought and each temper
Beneath His control.
Thus led by His Spirit
To fountains of love,
Thou then shalt be fitted
His mercy to prove.

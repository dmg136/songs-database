{t:Though the world may promise me more}

1. [D]Though the [G]world may promise me [D]more,
I'm just [G]made to be [A]filled with the [D]Lord.
Nor it's life worth [G]living a [D]day,
For the [G]things that will [A]soon pass a[D]way.

{soc}
Doesn't [G]matter how [D]rich or suc[G]cessful I'll [D]be,
Or [G]how many [D]pleasures be [Bm]offered to [D]me.
There's [G]nothing that [D]compares to [G]my desti[D]ny—
To be [G]thoroughly [A]filled with the [D]Lord.
{eoc}

2. Now although I'm still kind of small,
And the future is in front of me.
In my heart I've heard the Lord's call,
Just to follow Him absolutely.

{soc}
Though the path may be holding
Much joy or much pain,
What matters is that more of Him I would gain,
Regardless what happens,
I never would change.
'Cause I'm made to be filled with the Lord.
Yes, I'm [G]made to be [A]filled with the [D]Lord.

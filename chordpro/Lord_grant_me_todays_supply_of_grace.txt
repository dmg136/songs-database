{t:Lord, grant me today's supply of grace}

{soc}
[D]Lord, grant me to[G]day's sup[A]ply of [D]grace;
May Your di[G]vine life [A]grow a[D]pace;
Little by [G]little, [A]day by [Bm]day, to grow
More and [G]more, into [A]You.
{eoc}

1. [G]Day by day, bit by bit, [F#m]life will grow as is fit,
[Em]Increasing gradual[G]ly un[A]til,
[G]However imper[F#m]ceptibly,
[Em]Your life matures with[G]in [A]me.

2. I would be desperately, constantly, patiently,
Drawing each breath of life from You, Lord;
Knowing that every day while I breathe,
Your life will permeate me.

3. Every day, may I rest, knowing that each bequest,
Matches my daily need exactly;
Jesus Christ intercedes for me,
A member of His body.

{soc}
[D]Lord, grant me a [G]heavenly, [A]corporate [D]view;
That all of my [G]growth and [A]prayers to [D]You,
Little by [G]little, [A]day by [Bm]day,
Would cause building [G]up into [A]You.
{eoc}

4. [G]We would be corporately, [F#m]growing up steadily
[Em]Till we reach the stature of [G]Your full[A]ness;
[G]Transforming and con[F#m]forming us, Your
[Em]Manifested [G]peo[A]ple.

{soc}
Lord, grant me today's supply of grace;
May Your divine life grow apace;
Little by little, day by day, to grow
More and more, into You.
{eoc}

{soc}
Lord, grant me a heavenly, corporate view;
That all of my growth and prayers to You,
Little by little, day by day,
Would cause building up into the New Jerusalem.

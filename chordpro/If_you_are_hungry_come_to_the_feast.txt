{t:If you are hungry, come to the feast}

1. [G]If you are hungry, [B7]come to the feast.
[E7]Open to Jesus—[Am]He is all you need.
[D7]He fed the thousands, [G]now He'll feed [E7]you.
Just [A7]open your mouth and take Him in—
That's [D]all you have to [D7]do.

{soc}
We've found that [G]calling on Jesus [B7]fills us within.
[E7]He came as food, so [Am]now we take Him in.
No [CM7]concepts or forms that you [Cm]have to learn
To [G]come and meet with [E7]us.
Just en[Am]joy the [D7]Lord Je[G]sus!
{eoc}

2. If you are thirsty, He's heard your cry.
He is a fountain that will not run dry.
He's quenching our longings, we're satisfied,
Just eating and drinking the risen Lord!
Yes, that is why He died;

{soc}
So He could become the Spirit, get into us,
Fill all our being—Oh, how glorious!
It's really so simple—just take and eat;
That's all you have to do.
Come enjoy the Lord Jesus.

{t:There are times in my life}

1. [D]There are times in my [Bm]life
When my [Em]heart is em[A]bittered.
There are [D]questions un[Bm]answered,
Yet, [Em]You're drawing [A]me[A7]

{soc}
To enter
[D]Into Your blessed sanctu[Bm]ary
[Em]And turning my eyes heaven[A]ward,
[D]The questions of constant in[Bm]quiry
Are [Em]changed to these [A]words,[A7]
{eoc}

2. "Whom do I have in heaven
But You, dear Jehovah.
My flesh and my heart
Constantly fail,"

{soc}
But God's still
The strength of my heart and my portion;
To Him forever I'll draw near.
I've made Jehovah my sweet refuge.
So now throughout the years
{eoc}

3. Turn my view to see You,
How I need to see Jesus!
Though I don't understand
The ways that You take;

{soc}
Lord, make me
A babe and suckling always praising.
Enjoying Your worth day by day.
Let each experience constitute me
So Your life I'll dis[A]play[A7]
In every [D]way.
{eoc}

All scripture is God-breathed
And He showed me a river
And I saw the Lamb standing
Behold the New Jerusalem
Brothers I do not yet reckon myself
But holding to truth in love
But you, O man of God
Calling Oh Lord Jesus
Call, call, won't you call Jesus' name
Christ has come to be life
Christ is our light, our food, our air
Create in me a clean heart
Dearest Lord, You've called us here
Down from His glory
Draw me dear Lord
Drink a river pure and clear
Everybody ought to know
Every new day's a new start
Fallen, in her condition
Fallen, that's the way we all begin
From the morning to the evening
From the time I spoke Your name
Gathered in Thy name, Lord Jesus
Give yourself to love the Lord
God's economy and His eternal plan
God's eternal purpose is to have a group
God eternal has a purpose
God has called us for His purpose
God hath not promised skies always blue
God is love, who sent His beloved Son
God the Creator became a God-man
God wants someone to love Him
Good morning, Lord Jesus
Go on, go on, go on in the Lord
Hast thou heard Him, seen Him, Known Him
Have you found your human spirit
He understands you thoroughly
He washed away my sins
How could a country girl like me
How we love the glorious name
If I gained the world, but lost the Savior
If you are hungry, come to the feast
Immersed in Thy love
I'm gonna praise God unceasingly
I'm so attracted by Your love
I'm thankful that God has placed me
In a low dungeon, hope we had none
Is there someone who's a friend
It's the life, life, life
It passeth knowledge, that dear love of Thine
I've given up the world because
I've got a river of life flowing within me
I am crucified with Christ
I am not ashamed of the gospel
I have fought the good fight
I love God because He loved me
I love You, Lord Jesus, I love You, Lord, precious One
I once was dead, dead in my sins
I take Thy promise, Lord, in all its length
I want to be filled with the Triune God
I will enter His gates with thanksgiving
Jesus Lord, how we long to touch Thee
Jesus Lord, You're our first love
Jesus, O living Word of God
Just one touch of You, dear Lord
Just to be in You, as You're in me
Known of my Father before time began
Let your Christ be made known
Lord, grant me today's supply of grace
Lord, how I thank You that You died
Lord, how long, dear Bridegroom
Lord, I do thank You for another day
Lord, I give myself to You right now
Lord, I just love You
Lord, I love You, Lord, I need You
Lord, I love You, Lord, take my heart
Lord, I love You, thank You for opening my eyes
Lord Jesus, I love you you're my all
Lord Jesus, You're lovely
Lord, keep my heart always true to You
Lord, keep my heart open and soft toward You
Lord, now I see
Lord, there's nothing in this world like You
Lord, You are beloved fairest of the fair
Lord, You are more precious than silver
Lord, You are my only goal
Lord, You are the living spring
Lord, You love me so immensely
Lovers of Christ in His ascension
Love suffers long
Loving You, Lord's all I'm living for
Man's Creator has a purpose
Mary poured out her love offering
More of our heart, dear Lord
Morning dawn had arisen
My God, my portion, and my love
Nearer each day to me
Never did I dream before
Nothing's quite so precious
Nothing can content me more
Now from my heart comes
Now the Lord is the Spirit
Now the Triune God has come to dwell within
Oh the joy of having nothing
Once it was the blessing
Out of my bondage, sorrow, and night
O love that wilt not let me go
Praise the Lord, God sent His Son
Pray to fellowship with Jesus
Prod me with Your loving hands
Pursue Him and Know Him
Rain on me
Reading the Bible
Recall how David swore
Rise up, my love
Rivers of living water
Seek ye first the kingdom of God
Simply loving every day
Take time to behold Him
Therefore the redeemed of the Lord
Therefore with joy shall ye draw water
There's a gospel of today
There are times and times again
There are times in my life
There is a great mystery
There is a song within me
The Bible is God's breath
The gift of righteousness
The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit
The Lord is my light and salvation
The love of Christ is now constraining me
The love of God and the grace of Christ
The Son with the Father by the Spirit
Though I love You Lord
Though the world may promise me more
Touching Jesus
Turn turn my heart toward You
We have a most glorious King
We will sing to the Lord with our spirit
What about my sinful past
What made You, Lord, to die for me
What things were gains to me
Whenever the heart shall turn to the Lord
When all around my sky is falling
When I've run the race before me
When I grow up I want to be a man of God
When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion
Wither shall I go from Thy Spirit
With the kisses of Your mouth
You shall love the Lord with all your heart

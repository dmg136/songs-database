As this life flows through me & We'll abide mutually
Christ is our light, our food, our air
null
Thank You Lord, in Your eyes we find grace
O how I love Him How I adore Him
null
Do come, oh do come says Spirit and the Bride
He is dwelling in our spirit
O Lord, we can't do it on our own
null
Just by calling Jesus
That God is there for me tomorrow
Now my eyes begin to see
null
Each morning we must rise up
Lord Jesus, I love You
God's eternal purpose is to have a group
null
Oh, may a clear, controlling vision
But God hath promised strength for the day
God You did not spare Him
Lord, You are my choice & Lord, I love You
For this, He came down to us
null
Go on, go on, go on in the Lord
Captivated by His beauty
What is born of God is our human spirit
null
He tells me guard thy heart
This divine romance & In Your love I'm drawn
null
null
We've found that calling on Jesus fills us within
Moments with You
Now in our spirit we can feed
null
I live, if you stand firm in the Lord
Propitiation made by the blood
There is a someone
null
null
I'm for the Lord
Spring up, O well, within my spirit
I am crucified with Christ
null
Henceforth there is laid up for me
I love Him for all the things He's done for me
Jesus, Lord Jesus
null
null
So I will drink
He has made me glad
null
Lord, we've been drawn off by many things
Jesus, living Word
Nothing and no one can satisfy me but You anymore
God's dispensing His economy in His Trinity
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
null
Lord, grant me a heavenly corporate view
And Lord, how can I turn away from Your love
Come, Lord Jesus
null
null
null
Lord, look into me and infuse me
null
Lord, I love You, thank You for opening my eyes
Lord, I just open up to You
null
Your love constrains me to give my all to You
null
null
Lord, there's nothing in this world like You
Jesus, I love You
null
null
Every moment in so many ways
null
null
null
I give You the first place in all things by faith
Jesus Christ will get His kingdom
She took opportunity
We would count all things loss, but Jesus gain
null
null
null
null
I call His name, Lord Jesus, help me in my weakness
Jesus, You're my reason for being here
How I love to sing
O Lord, Amen, that's the way to let Him in
Oh, He's the wonderful Spirit in us
null
All in all forever
null
null
That's why I call on Him
Pray to fellowship with Jesus
null
Forgetting the things which are behind
null
Reading the Bible
null
null
Rivers of living water
null
Loving as the moments fly
null
They shall obtain gladness and joy
Call upon His name
Words like these fail to treat
By a touch of His dear love
To enter into Your blessed sanctuary
God fell in love with man
I'm loving Jesus, this lovely Person
null
So why not open up and call His name, O Lord
null
null
This charming One so excelling
From the throne of our God
Wonderful One, Son with the Father
Lord, I've seen Your purpose
Doesn't matter how rich or successful I'll be
null
Lord, I call
null
null
null
What made You die for me
I won't give up
Now the Lord is the Spirit
Oh, Lord Jesus
I'll be raptured into glory
And even though I'm still a kid
The Lord hath done great things for us
Whither shall I go from Thy Spirit
